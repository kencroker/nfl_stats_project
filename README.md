My goal for this project: Extract each NFL team's statistics and make them accessible for data analysis by placing them in a CSV file.

Visit the file labelled nfl_web_scraping.ipynb first.
In the nfl_web_scraping Jupyter Notebook file, you'll see all the steps I took to convert the stats from the NFL webpage into a CSV.
The webpage_screenshots folder contains all of the images displayed in the nfl_web_scraping Jupyter notebook file.
